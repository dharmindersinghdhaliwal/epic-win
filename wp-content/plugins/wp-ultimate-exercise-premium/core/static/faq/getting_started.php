            <h3>Exercies vs. Posts</h3>
            <p><strong>Exercies are just like normal posts</strong>. If you want to create a blog post that includes a exercise, just go to <strong>Exercies > Add New</strong>, give it a title, some content and add all the exercise data. The Exercise Box will automatically appear at the bottom of your content.</p>
            <p>Like regular posts your exercises will show up on your homepage and in categories, once published. If they don't, <a href="<?php echo admin_url('edit.php?post_type=exercise&page=wpuep_faq&sub=support'); ?>">contact us</a>!</p>
            <p>If you don't want the Exercise Box at the bottom of the content, just use the <em>[exercise]</em> shortcode to put it wherever you want.</p>

            <h3>Entering Ingredients the right way</h3>
            <p>Ingredients are a crucial part of your exercises, so make sure you enter them the right way.</p>
            <p>Our plugin requires <strong>4 different parts</strong> for each ingredient: the quantity, unit, name and any notes. Use the TAB key while entering to quickly jump between fields and keep adding ingredients.</p>
            <p>Make sure to keep your names consistent as these will be used to link ingredients. It allows your visitors to view all exercises using bacon, for example.</p>

            <h3>Adding Exercies to regular posts</h3>
            <p>Exercies should be acting just like regular posts, so you should only add exercises to normal posts if there is a specific reason.</p>
            <p>For example: a post called <em>The very best BBQ exercises for the upcoming summer</em> could include some exercises that you've published before.</p>
            <p>In these situations you can use the <strong>Shortcode Editor</strong> to add exercises to any post or page. Just click on our logo in the visual editor and it will help you create the correct shortcode.</p>

        <li>Make sure the <strong>permalink structure</strong> for your exercises is the same as the current one. By default WP Ultimate Exercise uses the /exercise/ slug, but if this doesn't correspond with your current setup your old links won't work anymore. Potential solutions:
            <ul>
                <li>Change the /exercise/ slug on the <strong>Exercies > Settings > Exercise Archive</strong> page to /your-current-slug/</li>
                <li>Remove the /exercise/ slug on the <strong>Exercies > Settings > Advanced</strong> page</li>
                <li>Use the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-post-type-permalinks/" target="_blank">Custom Post Type Permalinks</a> plugin for more complex permalinks like /year/month/</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

            WP Ultimate Exercise stores 4 different parts for each ingredient: quantity, unit, name and notes. This allows us to do things like the Unit Conversion feature and many others. Unfortunately Ziplist stores ingredients as one piece of text so we can't simply migrate this. We have an automated process that tries it's best but there will be mistakes. To ensure a good migration:
            <ul>
                <li>Make sure commonly used units are in the <strong>Exercies > Settings > Unit Conversion > Unit Aliases</strong> list</li>
                <li>Any other units you might use can be added on the <strong>Exercies > Settings > Import Exercies</strong> page</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Custom Fields will be created for fields that are not part of our exercises by default. You can manage these on the <strong>Exercies > Custom Fields</strong> page
        </li>
        <li>
            In WP Ultimate Exercise 1 exercise = 1 exercise post, so posts containing multiple exercises cannot be imported automatically. You can create a separate exercise for those and then include them with our [ultimate-exercise id=""] shortcode. There is some more information on the <strong>Exercies > FAQ</strong> page.
        </li>
        <li>
            If you have the Exercise Image field set in your Ziplist plugin it will replace the featured image of the post.
        </li>
        <li>
            There are a few things that cannot be imported due to plugin differences:
            <ul>
                <li>Links in ingredients</li>
                <li>Bold and italic text in ingredients</li>
                <li>Images in ingredients</li>
                <li>Cooking times: hours will be added as minutes (e.g. 1 hour, 15 minutes will become 75 minutes)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
